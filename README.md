# Face-Recognition-Door-Lock-System
Developed a two-factor authentication face recognition door lock system for enhanced home security, incorporating QR code scanning and Python-based face recognition algorithms using OpenCV for the software implementation.
Integrated the software with an Arduino-based door lock mechanism, written in Arduino C language, to control the
access based on facial recognition results
